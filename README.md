# Primeagen-Tribute
A little meme tribute for primagen for getting me through my disbeliefs and giving me something to work towards.
The images was a struggle, I first started with an image that fit the vibe of the tribute better but need cropping. I figured I could get it to crop correctly within CSS and align it with a background pretty easily. After so much chat gippity and googling I couldn't get the image to fit while having a nice border around all sides. So I scrapped that image and went for an already landscape type photo.
The body doesn't quite flow the best with everything when the page is minimized as it extends a little more than I'd like but that's alright.
